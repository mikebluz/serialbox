ToDos:

- Player: add ability to play multiple tracks in a playlist at once (mixer mode)
- Comments (on songs/playlists) and notifications (e.g., someone has shared a playlist with you, or commented on your song/playlist)
    - Direct/Group messaging
- Add "select audio source" option when recording (internal laptop mic is garbage)
- When Recording, stop playing when all tracks have ended (Promise.all and onended)
- Add pagination where it makes sense (all songs, etc.)
- Change persistence layer to being event-based
- Allow playlist of same name for same user? Maybe append a "-{timestamp}" if duplicate?
- Add digital time display to recorder
- Add ability to mix track levels (raise and lower individual track levels)
