ToDos:

- Fix progress slider on song click
    - Song plays but the slider does not progress until you pause, then it jumps to where it should be
- Reactor repeat/looping (modal?)
- Notifications (someone has shared a playlist with you)
    - Direct/Group messaging
- Record audio and save to drive
- Add ability to play multiple tracks at once
