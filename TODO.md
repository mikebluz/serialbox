ToDos:

- Implement repeat
- Implement loop (loop sections of song you can set via the progress bar)
- Implement shuffle (scope to loaded playlist for now, but would be cool to shuffle across playlists)
    - On press: stop playing if playing, do quick random sort on the playlist, queue up first track.
- Notifications (someone has shared a playlist with you)
    - Direct/Group messaging
- Record audio and save to drive
- Add ability to play multiple tracks at once
