ToDos:

- Loading screen when hitting "save" on playlist
    - Add status message when update is successful
- Comments (on songs/playlists) and notifications (e.g., someone has shared a playlist with you, or commented on your song/playlist)
    - Direct/Group messaging
- Add ability to play multiple tracks at once (mixer mode)
- Add "select audio source" option when recording
- When Recording, stop playing when all tracks have ended (Promise.all and onended)
- Add pagination where it makes sense (all songs, etc.)
- Change persistence layer to being event-based
- Allow playlist of same name for same user ? Maybe append a "-{timestamp}" if duplicate?
